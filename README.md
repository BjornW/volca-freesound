# Volca Freesound

Fill the [Korg Volca Sample](http://www.korg.com/us/products/dj/volca_sample/) with random samples from [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org/).

This app downloads random files from the Freesound audio database and transfers them to a Korg Volca Sample connected to the computer's audio output. The app runs in any browser that supports modern standards like Web Audio, which all major browsers like Firefox, Chrome and Edge do. It will run on desktop and mobile devices, as long as the device has a headphone or line audio output. Please find the Volca Freesound app here:
