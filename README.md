# Volca Freesound

### Fill the [Korg Volca Sample](http://www.korg.com/us/products/dj/volca_sample/) with random samples from [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org/).

This app downloads random files from the Freesound audio database and transfers them to a Korg Volca Sample connected to the computer's audio output. The app runs in any browser that supports modern standards like Web Audio, which all major browsers like Firefox, Chrome and Edge do. It will run on desktop and mobile devices, as long as the device has a headphone or line audio output. Please find the Volca Freesound app here:

### Korg Volca Sample

The [Volca Sample](http://www.korg.com/us/products/dj/volca_sample/) is a musical instrument by Japanese electronic instrument maker [Korg](http://www.korg.com/us/). The unusual thing about the Volca Sample is that it can't record sound. So it's not a sampler in the proper sense of the word, but a sample player. Samples must be transferred with a dedicated computer application.

### Freesound

[www.freesound.org](http://https.freesound.org) is a collaborate audio database where anyone can upload audio samples and recordings and share them under under Creative Commons licenses. It's an initiative by the [Music Technology Group](https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg) of Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona. More information on their [about](https://freesound.org/help/about/) page. Freesound maintains an API to retreive information and sounds from their database.
