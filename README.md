# Volca Freesound

### Fill the [Korg Volca Sample](http://www.korg.com/us/products/dj/volca_sample/) with random samples from [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org/).

This app downloads random files from the Freesound audio database and transfers them to a Korg Volca Sample connected to the computer's audio output. The app runs in any reasonably modern browser, desktop or mobile, as long as the device has a headphone or audio output. Please find the Volca Freesound app here:

### Korg Volca Sample

The [Volca Sample](http://www.korg.com/us/products/dj/volca_sample/) is a musical instrument by Japanese electronic instrument maker [Korg](http://www.korg.com/us/) that plays audio samples. The unusual thing about the Volca Sample is that it can't record sound. So it's not a sampler in the proper sense of the word, but a sample player. Samples must be transferred with a dedicated computer application.

### Freesound

[www.freesound.org](http://https.freesound.org) is a collaborative audio database where anyone can upload audio samples and recordings and share them under under Creative Commons licenses. It's an initiative by the [Music Technology Group](https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg) of Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona. More information on their [about](https://freesound.org/help/about/) page. Freesound maintains an API to retrieve information and sounds from their database.

## Quick start

1. Open [https://hisschemoller.github.io/volca-freesound/](https://hisschemoller.github.io/volca-freesound/)
2. Set the computer's volume level close to maximum.
3. For a neutral signal make sure any sound effects of equalizers on the computer are switched off.
4. Connect the computer's audio output to the Volca 'sync in' input.

6. Press 'Start' on the Volca Freesound page to start the transfer. 

#### Signs that things work

On the Volca Freesound page
- One of the squares in the grid of sample slots lights up to indicate a transfer is going on to that sample slot.
- The progress bar shows the percentage of transfer that is done.

On the Volca Sample
- The display shows the word 'data' to indicate it's receiving the sound.
- The various LEDs on the interface pulse while transferring.
